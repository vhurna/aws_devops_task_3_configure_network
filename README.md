# AWS Essentials: Deploy the netowork

We will run our Grafana deployment on an EC2 virtual machine, and before we deploy it - we have to prepare the network resources! Luckily, we already deployed a VPC in [prevous task](https://github.com/mate-academy/aws_devops_task_1_test_lab_setup) - now we need to add some resources on top of that. 

## Prerequirements

Before completing any task in the module, make sure that you followed all the steps described in the **Environment Setup** topic, in particular: 

1. Make sure you have an [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/free/) account.

2. Install [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html).

3. Install [PowerShell Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell?view=powershell-7.4).

4. Install [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli).

5. Log in to AWS CLI on your computer by running the command:
   
    ```
    aws configure
    ```

## Task Requirements 

In this task, you will prepare the network infrastructure for the EC2 instance we will use to run Grafana. 

To complete this task: 

1. Edit `terraform.tfvars` - fill out tfvars file with the outputs from the previous modules and your own configuration variables. You should use those variables as parameters for the resources in this tasj. This task requires only one variable - `vpc_id`, you can get if as terraform module output in the [first task](https://github.com/mate-academy/aws_devops_task_1_test_lab_setup). 

2. Edit `main.tf` — add resources, required for this task: 
    
    - use resource [aws_subnet](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/subnet) to deploy a subnet with a Name tag `grafana`. As a subnet range, you can use any IP address range, valid for your VPC. 

    - use resource [aws_internet_gateway](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/internet_gateway) to deploy an Internet Gateway with a Name tag `mate-aws-grafana-lab`. Make sure that the Internet Gateway resource is associated with your VPC. 

    - use resource [aws_route_table](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/route_table) to deploy a new route table with Name tag `mate-aws-grafana-lab`. Route table should be associated with the VPC you deployed earlier, and it has to have a route, which forwards all traffic through the Internet Gateway you have just added. 

    - use resource [aws_route_table_association](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/route_table_association) to attach your route table to the `grafana` subnet. 

    - use resource [aws_security_group](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/security_group.html) to create a security group with a name (and a Name tag) `mate-aws-grafana-lab`. Make sure the security group is associated with your VPC. 

    - use resource [aws_vpc_security_group_ingress_rule](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/vpc_security_group_ingress_rule) to create security group rules, which allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic from all source IPs, and SSH traffic from your public IP. To get your public IP you can use an [online tool](https://whatismyipaddress.com/). Take a note, that when creating a security rule with this terraform resource, you have to specify destination port range, rather than a single port. For example, if you want to allow connections to tcp ports from 255 to 512, you have to set `from_port` to 255, and `to_port` to 512. If you want to whitelist a single tcp port 8080, you have to set both resource properties `from_port` and `to_port` to 8080.  

    - uncommend (and update if required) the outbound security group rule, which allows all traffic from the virtual machine. 

3. After adding the code to the `main.tf`, review the file `outputs.tf` and make sure, that all output variables are valid and can output relevant values, as described in the output variable descriptions. 

4. Run the following commands to generate a Terraform execution plan in **JSON** format: 

    ```
    terraform init
    terraform plan -out=tfplan
    terraform show -json tfplan > tfplan.json
    ```

5. Run an automated test to check yourself:
 
    ```
    pwsh ./tests/test-tf-plan.ps1
    ```

If any test fails - please check your task code and repeat step 4 to generage a new tfplan.json file. 

6. Deploy infrastructure using the following command: 
    
    ```
    terraform apply
    ```
    Make sure to collect module outputs - we will use those values in the next tasks. 
    
5. Commit file `tfplan.json` and submit your solution for review.
